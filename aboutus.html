    <p>Jennes Kang is a student at UNC-Chapel Hill studying computer science and Spanish linguistics. She is a podcast enthusiast and picks Hidden Brain, Radio Ambulante, Philosophize this, and Thrilling Tales of Modern Capitalism as her favorites. After creating a couple of podcast episodes with her friend during her gap year and publishing them on a local radio station, she became interested in starting a podcast. She knew she wanted to work with a few friends who she clicks with and is happy to have created the current team that works well together. She is excited about the future of the podcast and for the team to create something from scratch and have a memory capsule that all of them can look back on after graduating from college. Her dream is to see all of her team members face to face after Covid, and be able to work and have fun together in person. During her free time, she likes learning languages, singing, playing the ukulele, and taking frequent naps.
