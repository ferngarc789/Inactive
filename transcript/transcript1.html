            Hello to all pioneers, visionaries, and innovators! Welcome to the first ever Passioners Podcast. I am your host, Jennes Kang. In this podcast, I and three of my friends, Mike, Claire, and Fernando, will interview some of the most innovative and inspiring entrepreneurs in different sectors and stages of business.

And please follow and rate us, they are like a virtual pat on the shoulder for us. 

            And now let’s get into today’s episode. 

            Minu, a fin-tech company, based in Mexico City, Mexico were founded by Nima Pourshasb (CEO), Rafa Niell (COO) and Paolo Rizzi (CTO). However, none of them were born and raised in Mexico. Mr. Pourshasb is Iranian, Mr. Niell is Spanish, and Mr. Rizzi is Italian nationalities. 

            This diversity is one of the strengths of the company as they have diverse perspectives on how different countries’ financial systems work. Mr. Rizzi, the Chief Technology Officer at Minu whom I had the pleasure to interview had actually lived in 7 different countries in his life. In 2007, when he decided to move from Spain to Mexico… 

            He found many things that were odd to him. Unlike Europe, in Mexico, employees are paid on a bi-weekly instead of a monthly basis. However, because people don’t trust the banking system, Mexico's economy is highly cash-dependent. People don’t like to keep their money in the bank instead they try to cash out all of their money when their paychecks are available. 

            So in those specific days to the ATM, you will see long queues.

            As I was saying, wow, are they have they getting for free something or what's happening there? You know, it was really strange to me. So the point is that the Mexican people, the economy of Mexico, it's a lot based into the cash transactions. 

            It is not surprising why people have lost trust in the banking system. In Mexico, the minimum mortgage rate is about 9% and it goes as high as 15%. This was a complete shock for Mr. Rizzi because in Italy, a percentage of the credit that goes over the 9% is illegal or in another word usury! Usury law prohibits the practice of charging above the 9% maximum interest rate. The average mortgage interest rate in italy is about 1-2%. However, in Mexico it was normal to receive 12 to 15% mortgage interest rate.

            But then things get even worse if eventually you are in an economic problem and you want. Just upgraded to solve your finance, you can get loans with debt at 60 at 200 percent. I saw some of that 500, 600 percent.

            Adding to this, lack of financial education in Mexico is a huge problem.

            People normally I used to spend more than one day. So that is not really education. For example, sometimes people I hear a lot of jokes also. So I need to give when it comes to your kids saying, you know, the day of these are for the month when they pay, you know, they they can spend their way into the everything in a night out, you know, taking some beers and a shot of tequila. OK, it's a joke, but it's about reality. I mean, eventually they lost everything in drinking, but they just spent their money.

            In 2015, Mr. Pourshasb and Mr. Neill worked together in a bank. During their time there, they successfully led a project to launch the first mobile-only bank in Mexico. However, even after work they continued to talk about different ways they can improve the banking system in Mexico. And they started to brainstorm ideas on ways they can improve the financial health of Mexican employees. 

            In an interview, Mr. Pourshasb stated “75% of Mexicans live from paycheck to paycheck with no savings for contingencies, 33% get loans from family, friends or institutions to cover their recurring expenses and 71% recognize that their largest source of stress is financial worries.” However,  “the current options are complex, inadequate, and expensive, and promote a cycle of indebtedness that favors poverty” 

            And from this realization, the Fintech Minu company was born. 

            Minu’s goal is to alleviate employees’ lack of liquidity by offering them instant access to their earned wages, so they don’t have to wait for payday. If emergency situations arise, they don't have to borrow money from other people or use credit cards with a high interest rate, but they will have access to the money that they have earned. As employees, the money we earn every day … 

            By law, we own it because I don't know if I already walked five days with my employee. Those five days legally are mine. So why do I have to wait to the end of the month and why not start thinking about the wages on demand as well? So if I need it, just let me take mine up about the company or whatever and just let's transfer to my to my bank account and let's use it because it's mine and I don't have to follow in this situation, but eventually I have to ask to somebody else does money.

            However, when the company partners with Minu, and employees have access to Minu’s service, they will realize that Minu does not give access to 100% of their pay before the actual payday. This is intentional. While MInu wants to provide access to liquidity, they also want to encourage employees to have financial responsibilities.  

            We also want that when you get your paycheck, you get something in your. So normally we do access to the 50 percent of this so that if you have any emergency, you can cover those emergencies. 

            Minu service is financially accessible to both the companies as well as the actual employees using the service. There is no contract fee when a company partners with Minu. For employees, Minu charges a fixed withdrawal fee of $1.80, regardless of the amount they are withdrawing, similar to an ATM fee. In addition, Minu provides employees with financial education free of charge.

            In the package that normally we offer to the companies, we do also they are called the IRS, the freelancer. So like financial wellness courses where we explain, you know, we go physically well before the covid. Of course, now we are organizing our local webinars, et cetera, where we try to to give a lot of tips and information about how to make a better use of their personal economies.

            Employees don’t need to open a new bank account or card. Whatever they earn that day is automatically available to them through the Minu app using the same payroll account. And for every paycheck, the balance is cleared. For their paycheck, they get whatever they earned for 15 days minus the money they took out through Minu before their payday.  

            It’s a win win and win for Minu, employers, and employees… 

            Minu earns a small fee every time employees withdraw money.  
            For employers, having the flexible option provided by Minu improves their talent attraction, retention, productivity and satisfaction. Minu’s service does not have a cost for employers, and there is no change to their payroll timing and processes. It is integrated with the payroll tool, which automates the data transfer so that no additional administrative work is generated.
            Employees have a peace of mind knowing that funds are immediately available when needed. And they don’t fall into a cycle of debt if they simply need an emergency fund before their payday. 

            Minu service is already adopted by 50 companies. Minu’s app currently has 6000 users and aims to finish 2020 with 40,000 users, and 142,000 users by the end of 2021 through strategic alliances with partners such as Edenred, the largest employee card player in Mexico with access to 4.5M users. In 2019, Minu raised one of the largest seed rounds in Mexico´s history of $6.5 million.

            when you get to the right project with the right people, right. Mean the right moment. So I think that that helped a lot… I love them because the team is very smart and very senior 

            I love them because … 

            Since it is such a fast growing fintech company, I thought Mr. Rizzi’s job as a Chief Technology Officer would be to code daily to fix bugs, improve services etc.. 
            But I found out it’s actually not. Haha what would you say your daily life looks like? 


            being called all the time. I start my day at eight thirty, normally all the days by 30 a.m. and call with the whole or my team and everyone just because I like to be and let feel my presence. So we just simply double check really quick. It's all about 15 minutes. Normally people would call the scrum call, you know, where we just talk really quick if we have some problem and you stop there if things are going great…. And then after that, there is a long series of other calls about coordinating tasks and coordinating strategies, issues or meeting with the order based on the normal course, meeting with the other co-founders and talk about, you know, the vision of, oh, we must have all of our product. So right now it's much more complex because there are so many figures.

            ..  but mainly I will say that as a co-founder and CTO, one of the biggest rules that I have and I would say most of those people that are in my roadshow live is to cheer up your team, give them a lot of space thrust into them, motivate a lot them. So every day there is at least one of to one to one calls where, you know, I am me and my and my other co-founders, we really care about them. And that's all. 

            Mr. Rizzi’s life now is composed of much more responsibilities than simply having the passion for technology. However, when he first became interested in software engineering, that’s all he needed. When he was 10 years old, he wrote a simple computer program for his dad, who was a professor, because he was jealous of the time that his dad was spending at work instead of hanging out with him. The computer program that he wrote automatized the repetitive calculations that his dad was doing, and saved his dad a lot of time to hang out more with him. 

            And his passion for technology and thrust for knowledge continued throughout his teenage years. Then when Mr. Rizzi was 19 years old, he enrolled in a university to study Software engineering. 

            Did you end up finishing your college education? If you started coding since 10, I am sure you were WAY ahead of your classmates. 

            I never had that pleasure, but it's it's funny because just in that first period when I had to be following the college university, I've been getting several courses for masters to people that already had their degree as a teacher, you know, expert in the sector. So, I mean, when you talk about technology, it's something different. … it's a lot based about the passion that you have with, you know, these falling in love with this matter, if you want to call it now. 
            Because normally, if you find something, something that it's orrible about, my job is that every day it comes out something new about a new library, a new system. So if you want to be always up to date, it's really frustrating and more. If you love it, you want to be always and try to do something about machine learning, intelligence, artificial intelligence, so you never stop to eat all the stuff. So if you go to the university, it's also really difficult to find. I mean, there are so many and so great, of course, I have no doubt. But it's also very difficult to find something that is really up up to date to the latest because every day there's something new. So for tech, for many people, applies these self-made people to study by themselves and they follow up. And then you get up to date and then you just do great stuff, you know? 


            During the first 6 months Mr. Rizzi was enrolled in a university, he met a group of four friends, and they started a company called Dadanet. 


            we founded a company which actually was an ISP Internet service provider… And what we were doing, we were mainly at the beginning in providing connectivity. … And just when we started it was a boom because, you know, Internet was was just at the beginning. We are talking about nineteen ninety eight, which also coding was at the beginning, of course …. And when we started me personally, I was from the beginning inputting myself, my hands on coding and always with the vision about, OK, oh, we can ultimately it's process now as usual, like I did with my father. So we started coding some innovative platform of the e-commerce… And actually when we did that, some of those platform ended. It was a great, great result.

            Dadanet’s eCommerce platform started to have big clients like the soccer team A.C. Milan, Vatican, and national banks. And it became one of the few internet companies listed on the Italian stock exchange at that time. 

            one year to another, from nine people, we became more than 200 people. Most of them we were developers. So I mean, other people in a company where you have salespeople and marketing, etc., I mean, it's OK when you are andred and eventually 90 of them are all developers. You can do magic, 

            Unfortunately, with the dotcom bubble, in 2001, the company had to close. 

            And you can imagine for all of us still now that I'm thinking it was a shock because it's like quitting as a baby that we have, you know, it burned with us and was growing with us and giving us all that emotions because we were just 19 years old. Well, different ages and going to the stock market and doing all this visibility worldwide because we had several proposals also from the company there. 

            So when that company, we had to close for several reasons, my my solution was so big that I decided to go out from Italy, literally. I mean, I said also because one of the main reason that I see why it happened, they are given to the bad Italian system.

            I decided to go abroad and then I started traveling and I stayed. As I told you, I lived in seven different countries where almost in every country where I've been, I started a new company.

            If I see some interesting challenge, it's from one week to another. It's just the timing to pack everything and move and then just accept the new venture and and. Well, actually, yea, I'm really happy to the decision. I took quite a while for what I'm doing now with Menal and actually also a great and lovely family that keeps my vote here.. 


            What is one thing you would tell your 20 year old self?

            NO NO TO your 20 years old self

            Just keep.Going and doing things as you are doing, because I'm so happy about what it has been doing, what I've been doing in the in those past years, and actually I don't regret anything about it, really. maybe maybe maybe there is just one thing. For example, people are afraid to, I don't know, for example, quit their job and start a new business, etc. And sometimes in your life, you try to dissipate big goals. That, for example, to me, why no one, the biggest as being is my daughter, for example. So maybe one of the suggestions I will give to that young guy of 20 is don't wait that late to discover the real love because it's something amazing. 

            Real love as in.. 

            Having a baby, not waiting that long because, well, I'm 30 right now and I have an amazing.

            Sorry did you say you are currently 30 year or 40 years old. Just to make sure I heard it right. 

            AND THE LATER PART

            That is heartwarming. I love that your wish for your younger self is not career-related, but family. I can tell that family is very important to you. 

            The general impression I got during this interview was how excited Mr.Rizzi became when he started talking about MINU’s mission, his previous work experiences, and more generally about technology, and even more generally just about LIFE. He is currently 40 years old, but I feel like I got a glimpse of his 10 years old self when he built that first computer program for his dad: just pure excitement, passion, and love for what he does.  

            MUSIC

            I would love not to sleep, for example. That is one of my biggest dream of my life. So normally, as I want to do so many stuff, I start my day day at like five thirty. I used to live in different countries is also because you need to get to know more about languages and peoples. So I mean, this thing about the knowledge and knowing as much as we can, so, so cool, you know.
