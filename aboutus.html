            picks Hidden Brain, Radio Ambulante, Philosophize this, and
            Thrilling Tales of Modern Capitalism as her favorites. After
            creating a couple of podcast episodes with her friend during her gap
            year and publishing them on a local radio station, she became
            interested in starting a podcast. She knew she wanted to work with a
            few friends who she clicks with and is happy to have created the
            current team that works well together. She is excited about the
            future of the podcast and for the team to create something from
            scratch and have a memory capsule that all of them can look back on
            after graduating from college. Her dream is to see all of her team
            members face to face after Covid, and be able to work and have fun
            together in person. During her free time, she likes learning
            languages, singing, playing the ukulele, and taking frequent naps.
